✅How to Contribute✅

If you want to contribute, you can ask for a pull request. For merge and changes, open an issue; we will come back to you shortly. If approved, checkout a new branch then make sure to not have the same branch name as the branches already created. Also make sure to start your branch name with "feature/". Finally you can make a pull request, we will validate if your code is valid.

Thank you !
